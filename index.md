### Welcome to my personal page !

I'm a post-doc researcher in physics, currently working with [Luc Deike](https://ldeike.princeton.edu/) in Princeton University on Atmosphere-Ocean interactions since December 2023. Previously, I was a PhD student in Paris in the [PMMH](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/) lab under the supervision of Benjamin Thiria and Sylvain Courrech du Pont on the efficiency of bioinspired propulsion. 

### Research interests

My work focuses on fluid mechanics, with a particular interest in interface dynamics and fluid-structure interactions. I have worked on a variety of problems, with fundamental interests as well as applications ranging from climate physics to the efficiency of bioinspired propulsion. My approach is to carry out model experiments on a laboratory scale supported by theoretical modelling and the use of numerical data. My work has also been enriched by multidisciplinary approaches, at the interface with life sciences and geophysics.
