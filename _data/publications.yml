- title: "Drainage and lifetime of thin liquid films: the role of salinity and convective evaporation"

  description: "Experimental study of thin liquid films in the presence of salt. We show that the drainage is unaffected by the salinity of the solution or the humidity of the air surrounding the film while the lifetime is controlled by evaporative rate."

  description: "Experiments investigating Burst and Coast locomotion in the context of propeller propulsion. Experiments show a reduction of the energetic cost of locomotion of 24% for a given velocity, and a model allows us to find the minimal drag reduction for intermittent locomotion to be interesting."
